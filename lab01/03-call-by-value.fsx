// Call-by-value reduction
// ============================================================================

// In call-by-value reduction, we want to reduce everything in the argument
// of the redex before doing the substitution. This means that if we have
// 
// (\x.x) ((\y.y) z)
//
// The argument first reduces to 'z' and then the whole term reduces to 'z'.
// (In call-by-name, the term first reduces to '((\y.y) z)' and then to 'z'.)

// TASK #1: Implement call-by-value reduction
let rec reduceCBV (term:Term) : option<Term> = 
  failwith "TODO"
  // * If the term is 'Application(Lambda(v, t1), t2)' then
  //   first try reducing the argument 't2' recursively
  //   - If this succeeds, return the reduced Application(Lambda(v, t1), t2reduced)
  //   - If this does not succeed, t2 is a value and we can do substitution
  // * If the term is 'Application(t1, t2)', try reducing 
  //   't1' and then 't2' recursively (in the same way as in CBN)
  // * If the term is anything else then it cannot be reduced


// TASK #2: Run implement recursive reduction 
// (this is the same as reduceAllCBN)

// If you try calling 'reduceAllCBN' or 'reduceAllCBV' on 'tinf'
// you get an infinite loop (in both cases)

// But what if we use 'tinf' as an argument to a lambda 
// function that does not use its argument? 
let tnop = Application(Lambda("x", Variable("z")), tinf)

// CBN will do the substitution first and so we get 'z'
